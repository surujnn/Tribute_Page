              <p>My friend was home one night, sleeping peacefully, when at 2am her door was banging very loudly. She woke up in fear and ran to the door worried something had happened to a family member. Her husband was soundly asleep when she opened the door. To her surprise she saw a group of men who classified themselves as ICE members. Her heart broke when they asked where her husband was, since he was an undocumented living in NYC. That same night they took her husband away and he was later sent to a nearby jail where he is held captive until his case is presented in front of a judge. She has no children, and is currently living alone in NYC.</p>

              <p>There were times when she felt like as if she were never a teenager. She had to raise me, her younger brother to be a well-respected man. Cherry grew tired of my behavior once and told me that everything she is doing, is to help us have a brighter future. It is not easy growing up without parents to guide their children, yet my sister had to find her own way, and a way for me. She made sure I was enrolled into the Charter High School she attended. She would also make sure I was doing my best in school, and even in times of her own stress, she would always make time to help me with homework. Time was very essential for her so she had to make every minuet count.</p>
